# Gartner-TakeHomeAssignment

## Installation process
 For this purpose, different softwares were installed.
 1. Visual Studio 2022
 2. My SQL 8.0 - for databse query 

 ## Where to find the code
  The code is avaialble in the Git repository. The link has been shared in the email id. It is a public domain repo so no access is required to it.
  There you can find the respo : Gartner- TakeHomeAssignment.

  ## How to run your code
  There is an .sln file attached to it and also containd the folder for the other required code dependencies.
  You can clone the repository to your local system and run the code.
  For the document given for refernce(YAML/JSON), it has been kept on the local path for reading and parsing purpose. So the 
  tester needs to put the file at the required path and update the same in the code.

  ## What would you have done differently if you had had more time
  If got an oppurtunity to create it in an detailed way, then I would have taken the repository pattern and would have created the layer architechutre for the same.
   Also, could have completed the Save and Display action could have been done.
